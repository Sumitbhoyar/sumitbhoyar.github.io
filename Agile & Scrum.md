## What is the software development life cycle?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

-   Requirement analysis
-   Planning
-   Software design such as architectural design
-   Software development
-   Testing
-   Deployment

Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model,  spiral model and Agile model.


## What is Agile methodology?
Agile is a process in which a team can manage a project by dividing it into several phases and involves regular interaction with stakeholders and continuous improvement and photography at all stages. The Agile approach starts with customers explaining how the final product will be used and what problem it will solve.

## What is a sprint in agile?

Sprint is a short, time-consuming period in which a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the heart of the scrum and agile methods, and getting good sprints will help your agile team deliver the best software in a few headers.

## What do you understand by Daily Stand-Up?

Answer: You may surely get an interview question about daily stand-up. So, what should be the answer to this question? The daily stand-up is an everyday meeting (most preferably held in the morning) in which the whole team meets for almost 15 minutes to find answer to the following three questions –

-   What was done yesterday?
-   What is your plan for today?
-   Is there any impediment or block that restricts you from completing your task?

The daily stand-up is an effective way to motivate the team and make them set a goal for the day.

## What is a backlog in agile?

A product backlog is a list of new features, changes in existing features, bug fixes, changes in infrastructure, or other tasks that a team can bring in to achieve a particular result. Product backlogs are the only authoritative source of what the team is working on.

## What's the difference between sprint backlog and product backlog?

**Sprint Backlog:**  It is generally owned by the development team. It only contains those features and requirements that are related to the specific sprint only. It is considered a subset of the product backlog. It is compiled of everything that must be done to complete a particular sprint. It only includes items that can be completed during each agile sprint. It is specific to the sprint goal only in a particular sprint.  
**Product Backlog:** It is generally owned and maintained by the project owner. It usually contains each and every feature of the product as well as the requirements of the product. It is compiled to everything that must be done to complete the whole process. It just breaks down every item into a series of steps. It is more specific to the end goal of the product.

## What is Spike and Zero Sprint in Agile?

**Spike:**  It generally refers to a too large and complex user story in software development that cannot be estimated until the development team runs a timeboxed investigation. These stories can be used for various activities like research, design, exploration, prototyping, etc. Spikes are usually created to resolve some technical issues and design problems in the project.

**Zero Sprint:**  It generally refers to the first step or pre-preparation step that comes just before the first sprint. It includes all activities such as setting a development environment, preparing backlog, etc.

## What is a tracer bullet?
It can be defined as a spike with the current architecture or the current set of best practices. The purpose of a tracer bullet is to examine how an end-to-end process will work and examine feasibility.

## What do you mean by the term “velocity” in Agile?

Velocity is one of the planning tool used to estimate the speed of the work and time of completion of the project. The calculation of velocity is done by reviewing the work team has successfully completed during earlier sprints; for example, if the team completed 5 stories during a two-week sprint and each story was worth 3 story points, then the team’s velocity is 15 story points per sprint.


## What is a Product Roadmap?

A product roadmap, as the name suggests, is a powerful tool that describes how a product is likely to grow over time. It is a holistic view of product features that create the product vision. It also indicates what development is building, business goals that the new product will achieve, problems that the product will solve, etc. A product roadmap is owned by the product manager. It also encourages the development team to work together to achieve the desired goal for the successful delivery of the product.

## What is the difference between Agile and Scrum?

 - Agile: It is a methodology that is used for software management and project management.
 - Scrum: It is just a form of Agile that fully describes the process and its steps.
 It is basically an approach or implementation of agile methodology.

## Difference between extreme programming and scrum?

Scrum teams usually have to work in iterations which are known as  **sprints** which generally last up to two weeks to one month long while XP team works in the iteration that lasts for one or two weeks.  
XP teams are more flexible as they can change their iterations while Scrum teams do not allow any change in their iterations.  
The product owner prioritizes the product backlog but the team decides the sequence in which they will develop the backlog items in scrum methodology. Whereas XP team works in strict priority order, features developed are prioritized by the customers.

## What is Kanban?

It is one of the common agile interview questions. Kanban is a tool which helps the team to keep a close eye the work i.e., to measure its progress. Apart from the progress, the status of a development story can be seamlessly described with the help of ‘kanban board’.  
Kanban board aids in writing the whole scenario of a project at a single place to give a perfect picture of the bottleneck, a task done, workflow progress. It helps in the continuous delivery of the product without overburdening the team.

## What is a Taskboard in Agile?

**Answer:**  Taskboard is a dashboard that shows the progress of the project.

**It contains:**

-   **User Story:**  It has the actual business requirement.
-   **To Do:**  Tasks that can be worked on.
-   **In Progress:**  Tasks in progress.
-   **To Verify:**  Tasks pending for verification or testing
-   **Done:**  Completed tasks.

## What is Scrum ban?

It is a software development model that is a combination of Scrum and Kanban. Scrumban is considered for maintaining projects in which there are frequent changes or unexpected user stories. It can reduce the minimum completion time for user stories.

## What do you mean by Pair Programming and its advantages.

Pair programming, as the name suggests, is a type of programming where two people write code together and work side-by-side on one machine or computer. It is basically a technique mostly used in agile software development. In this type of programming, one person writes code and another person checks and reviews each line of code. Both of them also switch their roles while doing work.

**Advantages of Pair Programming**

-   Develop higher-quality code
-   Reduce the risk of errors
-   An effective way to share knowledge
-   Enhanced productivity
-   Improved team collaboration

## What are Burn-up and Burn-down charts in Agile?

**Burn-up Chart:**  It is a type of chart that is used to display or represent the amount of work that has been completed and the total amount of work for a sprint or iteration.  
**Burn-down Chart:**  It is a type of chart that is used to display or represent the amount of work that is remaining to be completed in the project. These charts are very simple and easy to understand.


## What is “Planning Poker” technique?

Planning Poker, also known as Scrum Poker, is a consensus-based technique that not only helps agile teams to estimate the time and effort that is required to complete each initiative on their product backlog but also identifies issues before time and within the course of a user story. It makes the meeting more short, productive and creates estimates with the involvement of the whole team. It is mainly used to avoid the influence of other participants, and force each person to think independently and give their opinion.

## What is a Sprint Planning Meeting, Sprint Review Meeting and Sprint Retrospective Meeting?

-   **Sprint Planning Meeting:**  In this meeting, the discussion takes place about features and product backlog items (user stories) that are important to the team. This meeting is usually attended by the product owner, Scrum Master and Scrum Team. It is a weekly meeting and usually lasts for about an hour.
-   **Sprint Review Meeting:** In this meeting, the Scrum team gives a demonstration of the product. After this, the product owner determines which items completed and which are not completed. He also adds some additional items to the product backlog on the basis of feedback from customers or stakeholders. Its main aim is to inspect the product being created in the sprint and modify it if required.
- **Sprint Retrospective Meeting:** This meeting takes place after the Sprint planning meeting. In this meeting, the Scrum team meets again to inspect itself and discuss the past mistakes, potential issues and methods to resolve them. Main aim of this meeting is to improve the development process. This meeting lasts for about 2-3 hours.

## What are standard or common metrics for Agile? Explain.

Agile Metrics are basically standard metrics that are used to measure the work of the team. These metrics are used to determine the quality of work, productivity, progress, team health, etc. Its main focus is on value delivered to customers and how much end-users were impacted by it.  
**Standard Metrics for the Agile project**

-   **Velocity:**  It measures the amount of work done by the development team during a sprint. It gives ideas about progress, capacity, etc.
-   **Cumulative Flow Diagram:**  It is a flow diagram used to measure the current status of work in progress of the team. It is simply used to track the progress of agile teams and manage flow stability.
-   **Defect Removal Awareness:**  It is used to measure the ability of the development team to remove defects prior to release. It helps to maintain the quality of products by a working team.
-   **Work Category Allocation:**  It is used to measure where we are spending or investing our time so that we can adjust our priorities.
-   **Sprint Burndown Metric:**  It is used to measure the total number of sprints or tasks that are completed as compared to estimated scrum tasks. It usually tracks the progress being made on tasks during a Sprint.
-   **Defect Resolution Time:**  It is used to measure the time taken by the team to identify and fix the defects or bugs in the software. There are several processes involved in fixing bugs.
-   **Time Coverage or Code Coverage:**  It is used to measure the time that is given to code during testing. It helps one to understand how much code is tested and also helps in assessing the test performance.
-   **Business Value Delivered:**  It is used to measure the efficiency of the working team.

## What are different roles in Scrum?
**Scrum Master:** Scrum Master is basically a team leader or supervisor of a team who is responsible for ensuring that the scrum team executes committed tasks properly.  
**Product Owner:** The product owner is basically a stakeholder of the project who is responsible for managing the product backlog. He is also responsible for defining a vision of what to build for the team.  
**Development Team:** It involves an individual person and each person is responsible for working collectively to complete a particular project. It is the team that is responsible for developing actual product increments and meeting sprint goals.

## What are the responsibilities of Scrum Master?
-   Protect the team from distractions
-   Motivate and guide the team to achieve the sprint goal
-   Build a self-organized and motivated team
-   Increase efficiency and productivity of the team
-   Ensures that the team delivers expected value during the sprint
-   Ensures that the team follows values, practices, and principles of Scrum
-   Eliminate external blockers and manage internal roadblocks
-   Lead the meetings and resolve any kind of issues

## What are the main artifacts of Scrum Framework?
-   **Product Backlog:**  It is a list of all requirements from clients or stakeholders that are needed in the product and should be accomplished before the end of the project.
-   **Sprint Backlog:**  It is a list of all finalized user stories, bug fixes, work items, etc., that are completed and selected by scrum to be completed during the current sprint.
-   **Product Increment:**  It is the version of the end product derived from the completion of each Sprint.

## Explain the terms User story, Epic, and Tasks in Scrum?
-   **Epic:**  It is basically a large story that cannot be completed in a single sprint. Therefore, epics are sub-divided into multiple, smaller user stories before they can be worked on.
-   **User story:** These are the smallest units that can be fitted and completed in one sprint. User stories are further broken down into different tasks.
-   **Tasks:**  These are detailed pieces of work that are necessary to turn user stories into workable components.

## Explain TimeBoxing in Scrum.

Timeboxing is an important time management technique or tool that is used to limit the amount of time that is being spent to complete a task. It simply allows a fixed unit of time for each and every task and this unit is known as a time box. The maximum length of the time box is 15 minutes. It not only helps to improve focus but also results in an increase in productivity. There are some events in Scrum and all these events are timeboxed which means all these events are allotted with a maximum and fixed unit of time for the task. The events that are time-boxed are listed below:

-   Sprint
-   Sprint Planning
-   Daily Scrum
-   Sprint Review
-   Sprint retrospective

## Explain the term “story point” in Scrum.

Story point is basically a unit to estimate total efforts that are required to complete or to do a particular task or user story. It gives more accurate measures, reduces planning time, predicts releases date more accurately.

## What do you mean by Scrum of Scrums (SoS)?

Scrum of Scrum, as the name suggests, is an Agile technique that involves meeting more than one scrum team and integrating the work of each team working on the same project. In simple words, it coordinates the work of multiple teams who need to work together to deliver complex solutions. In this meeting, members or representatives of individual teams share their high-level updates about their respective team’s work. Its main is to ensure coordination and integration of output from multiple teams by eliminating impediments if present.

## When can you say your story is ready to develop/groom enough to deliver?
Ready is a stable state of Scrum that is linked to a user story. As per the Definition of Ready (DoR), a user story have to satisfy some conditions before picking it up for a sprint i.e. to be in the ready state. So, the conditions that are essential for the development/grooming of a user story specify if the user story is ready to develop/groom enough to deliver or not.

Basically, the following questions should be answered to consider a user story ready:

**Why:** Is it clear what the business or stakeholders are trying to achieve?

**What:** Is the goal or outcome of the user story clear?

**How:** Is the strategy for the implementation of user story clear? Is the story is small enough?


## How does an agile team maintain requirements?

Agile teams keep their needs afloat after falling behind. In Scrum, it is called Product Backlog. They have an agreement between the stakeholders and the project managers regarding the delivery of the product through a specific operation by the customer project team. Agile teams use product backlogs to manage their needs.

The Agile team is ‘a leading group of people’ who work together on a project and have all the needs and people needed to produce a proven product promotion. Product owners work by prioritising customer needs. They work with the number of people needed as a team to deliver the products and customer needs needed at the beginning of the sprint.

## What is the user story and epic in agile?

The **user story** is the smallest work unit in the agile framework. It is the ultimate goal, not the feature, expressed in the user’s view of the software.
**Epic** is a great work that can be divided into a few stories, sometimes called “Problems” in Jira. Epics tend to bring together multiple teams on multiple projects and can be tracked across multiple boards. Epics are probably regularly distributed over a collection of sprints. As the team learns more about epic through customer development and feedback, user stories will be added and removed as needed. That’s the key to agile epics: Scope changes, depending on customer feedback and team cadence.

## What is product backlog in agile?

A product backlog is a list of new features, changes in existing features, bug fixes, changes in infrastructure, or other tasks that a team can bring in to achieve a particular result.
